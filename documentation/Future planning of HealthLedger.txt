How can we scale the application:

That is the most important question for any startup! HealthLedger has a very strong foundation for multiple monetization strategies because it sits at the intersection of three highly valuable fields: Healthcare Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain.

Here are the best ways you can monetize this application in the future:

1. "Model-as-a-Service" (API Access)
Once your Federated Learning network has trained a highly accurate medical AI model (like the CVD model), you own a very valuable asset.

How it works: You expose this trained global model via an API.
Who pays: Clinics, telehealth apps, or insurance companies pay a micro-fee (e.g., $0.05) every time they send patient data to your API to get a diagnostic prediction.
2. Sponsoring Training Rounds (B2B Marketplace)
Pharmaceutical companies, research universities, and large healthcare networks are desperate for diverse medical data to train their models, but privacy laws (HIPAA) make it hard. HealthLedger solves this.

How it works: A Pharma company wants to train a model to predict a rare disease. They come to HealthLedger and "fund" a training round with real money (or crypto).
Who pays: The Pharma company pays a large fee (e.g., $50,000) to initiate the round. HealthLedger takes a 20% platform cut, and the remaining 80% is distributed automatically via smart contracts to the Doctors, Patients, and Hospitals who contributed their local data to train the model.
3. SaaS Subscription for Hospitals
You can package the HealthLedger portal as a premium Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) for modern hospitals.

How it works: Hospitals pay a monthly subscription to be part of the network.
Why they pay: In return for subscribing, the hospital’s own diagnostic tools get constantly smarter because they have access to the global, aggregated AI model, leading to better patient outcomes.
4. Patient Premium Features
While core participation might be free, you can offer premium tools for patients.

How it works: Patients own their health data on the blockchain. You could offer a "Premium Wallet" dashboard that gives them advanced AI analytics on their own historical health trends or matches them with paid clinical trials based on their secure profile.
5. Native Tokenomics (Web3 Approach)
Since you are built on blockchain (Polygon), you could eventually launch your own utility token (e.g., $HLTH).

How it works: To use the network, research institutions must buy and spend $HLTH tokens. Patients and doctors earn $HLTH tokens for contributing good data. As the network becomes more popular, the demand for the token increases, and the HealthLedger treasury (which holds a reserve of tokens) becomes highly valuable.
The best starting point? Strategy #2 (B2B Marketplace). Pitching the platform to research institutions as a secure, privacy-preserving way to crowdsource AI training on medical data without ever violating patient privacy is a massive immediate value proposition.

Switching from testnet to main wallet: 

Switching from the Polygon Amoy Testnet to the real Polygon Mainnet (or Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum, etc.) is the ultimate goal. When you do this, the application handles real transactions with real money (real MATIC).

What changing to Mainnet means:
Real Money for Gas: Every time the backend writes to the blockchain (registering a user, submitting a new global model weight, opening a training round), your Admin Wallet must pay real MATIC for the transaction fee.
Real Token Value: If you implement a reward system, tokens paid out to patients and doctors would have real USD value traded on crypto exchanges.
Permanent Data: Everything written to the smart contract is permanent and immutable on the public ledger.
How to switch HealthLedger to Polygon Mainnet:
The beautiful thing about your architecture is that it's designed to switch networks with just a few configuration changes.

Here are the 4 steps you would take when you are ready to launch "for real":

Fund your Admin Wallet: You need to buy real MATIC (e.g., on Coinbase, Binance) and send it to the PRIVATE_KEY wallet address that your backend uses. This wallet needs a balance to pay for the system's gas fees.
Deploy the Smart Contract to Mainnet:
Currently, you deployed 

HealthLedgerFL.sol
 to Amoy.
You will use Hardhat to deploy that exact same contract code to the Polygon Mainnet. You will get a new Contract Address.
Update Backend Environment Variables (.env):
Change POLYGON_AMOY_RPC to a Mainnet RPC (e.g., https://polygon-rpc.com/ or an Alchemy/Infura Mainnet URL).
Change CONTRACT_ADDRESS to the new Mainnet address you just deployed.
Update Frontend Users:
Ensure REACT_APP_ENABLE_TEST_WALLETS is set to false. Real users must use MetaMask for security on Mainnet.
Your users will now connect their MetaMask to "Polygon Mainnet" instead of "Polygon Amoy".
Because ethers.js communicates identically with Amoy and Mainnet, you don't need to rewrite any of your core JavaScript or Smart Contract code to make the switch! It's purely a configuration and deployment change.
